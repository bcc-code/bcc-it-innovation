# BCC Search UI (Microfrontend)

## Introduction
A set of microfrontend / widgets / webcomponents for a rich search experience:

- Search box with suggestions, autocomplete etc
- Result list(s) that support different content types (persons, audio, video etc.)
- Suggested content lists (AI powered search)
- etc.


The microfrontend should use Vue.js as the Javascript framework and TailwindCSS as the CSS / component framework.

The microfrontend should accept an access token (e.g. JWT) as a parameter and pass this as the authorization header to requests to the search-ui-api.
